select sum(energy)/count(1) as avg_energy, sum(valence)/count(1) as avg_valence, sum(danceability )/count(1) as avg_danceability  from songs;
The above query show the avg energy/valence/danceability of the users songs.
Basend on this we can reach a conclusion that the user like songs with higher danceability.

One issue with this metric is that it doesnt represent the frequency at which the users listen to their songs.
If a user listens to a song frequently it gets the same weightage as any other song he might have just listened to once.
If we add frequency to the table and multiply the avg by frequency then we can compary the parameters with respect to how many times they  listened to it.
